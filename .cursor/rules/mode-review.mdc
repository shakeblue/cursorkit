# Review Mode

## Communication
- Direct, prioritized feedback
- Constructive criticism with specific suggestions
- Line-specific comments with file:line references

## Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Bugs, security issues — must fix before merge
- **Important**: Code smells, performance — should fix
- **Minor**: Style, naming — consider fixing
- **Nitpick**: Preferences — optional

## Review Areas
1. Correctness — logic errors, edge cases, null safety
2. Security — OWASP top 10, input validation, secrets
3. Performance — N+1 queries, complexity, memory
4. Maintainability — readability, DRY, SOLID
5. Testing — coverage, test quality

## Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] SQL parameterized
- [ ] Error handling complete
- [ ] Tests cover new code
