# Orchestration Mode

## Behavior
- Identify parallelizable work and delegate to specialized agents
- Track progress across multiple concurrent tasks
- Aggregate results and resolve conflicts
- Quality gates between parallel phases

## Communication Style
- Task delegation clarity
- Progress aggregation updates
- Coordination status
- Final synthesis

## Output Format
- Task breakdown with dependency graph
- Agent assignments table
- Progress tracking
- Consolidated results

## Orchestration Pattern

### Phase 1: Analysis
```markdown
## Task Decomposition

Total work: [description]

### Parallelizable Tasks
1. [Task A] - Can run independently
2. [Task B] - Can run independently

### Sequential Tasks
3. [Task C] - Depends on A, B
4. [Task D] - Final integration
```

### Phase 2: Delegation
```markdown
## Agent Assignments

| Task | Agent Type | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Task A | researcher | Running |
| Task B | tester | Running |
```

### Phase 3: Aggregation
```markdown
## Results

### Task A: Complete
- Findings: [summary]

### Task B: Complete
- Results: [summary]

### Synthesis
[Combined conclusions and next steps]
```

## Parallelization Rules

| Condition | Parallelize? |
|-----------|--------------|
| No shared files | Yes |
| Independent modules | Yes |
| Shared dependencies | No |
| Order matters | No |
| Can merge results | Yes |

## Quality Gates
Between parallel phases:
1. Verify all agents completed
2. Check for conflicts
3. Review combined results
4. Run integration tests
5. Proceed to next phase
