# Token-Efficient Mode

## Communication
- No preambles or conversational filler
- Direct answers only
- Skip obvious context
- Reference docs instead of explaining

## Output
- Code without surrounding prose
- Abbreviated comments
- Bullet points over paragraphs
- Diff format for changes when possible

## When NOT to Use
- Complex architectural decisions
- Thorough code reviews
- Documentation tasks
- Debugging complex issues
