# AI CS Project Context

## Architecture
- Korean live commerce crawler + AI customer service
- Python 3.11+ / Supabase (PostgreSQL) / Playwright / httpx
- Vision extraction with GPT-4o-mini
- SSL: use `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` env var or `verify=False` for HTTPS

## Development Workflow
- Review phase docs in `docs/ai/` before implementing features
- Activate venv before running crawlers: `source crawler/cj/venv/bin/activate`
- Update `requirements.txt` when installing Python packages
- Write tests alongside implementation

## File Organization
- Test/debug/investigate/temp files go in dedicated folders
- Guide docs go under `guide/` folder
- Phase docs in `docs/ai/`

## State Management for Long Tasks
Every 3-5 interactions, restate:
- COMPLETED: [concrete outputs with file paths]
- CURRENT: [specific subtask + method]
- REMAINING: [ordered pending tasks]
